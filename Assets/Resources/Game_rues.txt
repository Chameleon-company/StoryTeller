STORYTELLER BOARD GAME

Game rules and mechanics document

-----------------------------------------
Introduction
The Storyteller (also called The Message Stick) is a board game based on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge systems. The purpose of the game is not to win, but to learn, reflect, and share stories during a journey through different cultural areas.

As Trackers (players) journey through Waterholes and Knowledge Areas, they collect cultural artifacts and knowledge, pause for reflection, and eventually reach the central Meeting Place. Here, as in Aboriginal oral traditions, each Tracker shares a story.

When a Tracker has completed their journey and shared their story aloud, they are initiated as the ultimate warrior The Storyteller, carrying forward knowledge he gained.

The game encourages respectful listening, cultural understanding, and storytelling â€” important values in Indigenous culture.
