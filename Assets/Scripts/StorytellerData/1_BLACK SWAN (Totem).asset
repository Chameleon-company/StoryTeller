  title: BLACK SWAN (Totem)
  description: The black swan (Cygnus atratus) is a large waterbird, a species of
    swan which breeds mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of Australia.
    Within Australia, the black swan is nomadic, with erratic migration patterns
    dependent upon climatic conditions. It is a large bird with mostly black plumage
    and a red bill. It is a monogamous breeder, with both partners sharing incubation
    and cygnet-rearing duties. (Wikipedia)
