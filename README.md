## About the Project

**StoryTeller** is a digital game based on the original physical board game created by Glenn Shea, a respected Aboriginal elder from the Wathawurrung community.  
The physical game is designed as an educational experience to foster cultural understanding through storytelling and interactive gameplay.

Our university team is developing a new **online multiplayer version** of the game, using Unity, to expand its reach to primary and secondary school students across Australia and beyond.

You can try the current version of the board game online here:
